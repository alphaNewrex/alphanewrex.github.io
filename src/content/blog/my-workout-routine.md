# My Workout Routine

Hey everyone! Today, I thought I'd share something a bit different—my workout routine. I'm not a fitness guru by any means, but I've found a routine that works well for me, keeps me energized, and helps me stay consistent. I prepared this routine with the help of a gym-bro I met during my internship in Bangalore (yes, something good did come out of Bangalore!). I've been following this routine for about a year now, and I can confidently say it's been quite effective.

Hopefully, you'll find some inspiration or ideas here!

## Day-by-Day Routine
My routine is structured around a six-day split, focusing on each muscle group twice a week (except legs, which Everyone reading this would agree is not the most fun day). I usually take Sundays off to rest and recover.

I usually hit shoulders on the monday instead of triceps is because my shoulders have gotten sufficient rest over the weekend that they are ready to be destroyed again, and also it being a large muscle group, they are fresh on Monday.

I also try to take a minute or two of rest between sets, and I don't do any cardio. I prefer to keep my workouts intense and focused on strength training.

Here's how my typical week looks:

*(P.S. I usually try to go to failure on most exercises.)*

## My Diet

I'm not overly strict with my diet, but I try to keep it balanced and nutritious.

After a long week, I usually enjoy cheat meals over the weekend. I often crave a good burger or pizza, topped off with a chocolate-loaded waffle.

As for my supplement intake, I keep it simple:

- **Protein:** Two scoops of whey protein post-workout. My current favorite is Impact Whey from MyProtein (Strawberry Cream flavor).
- **Clean Whey Isolate:** I occasionally (well, it's become daily now!) sip on a scoop of MyProtein's Clean Whey Isolate throughout the day.
- **Creatine:** Monohydrate - 5g daily.

That's it! Nothing fancy—just consistency, balance, and a bit of fun. I'd love to hear about your routines or any tips you might have. Feel free to reach out or comment below!

Stay healthy and happy training! 💪
